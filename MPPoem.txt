Homework Machine 
The homework machine, oh the homework machine, 
Most perfect contraption that’s ever been seen. 
Just put in your homework then drop in a dime,
Snap on the switch and in ten seconds time, 
Your homework comes out, quick and clean as can be. 
Here it is -"nine plus four?" and the answer is "three." 
Three? 
Oh me . . .
I guess it’s not as perfect As I thought it would be.
