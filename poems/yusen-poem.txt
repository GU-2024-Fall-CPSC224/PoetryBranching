Beneath the stars so vast and bright,
A wanderer walks through endless night.
With dreams that soar and heart so free,
They chase the call of mystery.

Through fields of gold and seas so wide,
The world unfolds with every stride.
A path unknown, yet full of light,
Guides the soul through dark and bright.

So may you wander, far and true,
For lifeâ€™s a journey, meant for you.
Embrace the road, let worries go,
And watch your spirit bloom and grow.
