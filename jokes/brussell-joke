A Java programmer walks into a bar and orders a drink. The bartender asks, “What’s your poison?”

The programmer replies, “I’ll have a Java, please.”

The bartender smirks and says, “Sorry, we only serve C++ here.”

The programmer raises an eyebrow and asks, “What’s the difference?”

The bartender grins and says, “In C++, you can manage your own memory—but here, we just let the bouncers handle the cleanup... and they definitely don’t have a garbage collector!”
