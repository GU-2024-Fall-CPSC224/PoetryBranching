A Java programmer walks into a bar and orders a drink. The bartender asks, "What’s your poison?"  

The programmer replies, "I’ll have a Java, please."  

The bartender nods and says, "Sorry, we only serve C++ here."  

Confused, the programmer responds, "What’s the difference?"  

The bartender grins and says, "In C++, you can manage your own memory—but here, we prefer to let the bartender take care of the cleanup!"
